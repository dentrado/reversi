# Reversi

An Reversi/Othello AI written in Clojure.

The game-tree is generated and and searched lazily (with alphabeta pruning)
as described in
[Why functional programming matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html)

Many of the strategy/heuristic algorithms are based on the strategies described
in chapter 18 of [Paradigms of AI Programming](http://norvig.com/paip.html)
